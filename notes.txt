we have a shop named as fatima traders 
they sale 5 products on daraz 
now daraz p 1 caror say above products hain 
in one portion we have name , email , address , products details etc  of fatima traders 
in another portion we have many products like fatima traders kay products , xyz products , abc products & so on 

from the first portion we have an array of products in data base of fatima traders
[product1 , product2 , product3 , product4 , product5]
in the array we assume above we don't put products we put id's [id , id , id , id ] => referencing 
If we put whole data detail in array it is called as ambadding . 
[product1_FullData , product2_FullData , product3_FullData , product4_FullData]

referencing is the one which use mostly in the industry as well as the difference is just of idea 
khud kay model ya collection mai bh data ho product ka as well as user kay collection mai bh h same data means hmny data ki 2 copies bna li hain and hm us copy ko dono jagh use kar rhy hain 
agar hm user ki collection mai bus id rakhain it is referencing and exact same data copy kar kay rakhain to it is ambadding 
ambadding mai aik he faida h data jaldi read ho jata h where as is mai space ziada lagti h
